This project is still in early stage: it's largely work in progress, and incomplete.

## How to view models

Models are available in a single [Astah](http://astah.net/) file.

To open it, simply install [Astah Community edition](http://astah.net/editions/community).

Note: models are navigable via hyperlinks, just click on an element to open subsequent model (when an hyperlink is available, you should see a small square with an arrow next to the element).
